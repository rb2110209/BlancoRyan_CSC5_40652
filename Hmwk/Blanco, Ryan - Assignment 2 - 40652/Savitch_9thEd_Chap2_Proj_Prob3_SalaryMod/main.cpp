 * Purpose:  Write a program that takes an employeeâ€™s previous annual
salary as input, and outputs the amount of retroactive pay due the employee,
the new annual salary, and the new monthly salary. Modify your program from 
Programming Project 2 so that it calculates the retroactive salary for a worker 
for any number of months, instead of just 6 months.
